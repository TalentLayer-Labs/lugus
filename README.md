# Meet Lugus a ETHLisbon 2022 Hackerthon submission!
Claim tokens. Convert to your preffered token. Schedule pay outs. 
All in one click!

While attending ETH Lisbon, part of the TalentLayer team built Lugus. Lugus is an automated token claim scheduling and auto-conversion system; a module that can be plugged into TalentLayer. It is a tool that can be applied generally across Defi use cases (auto-converting a basket of tokens into a desired token and remitting to a user’s wallet on a set schedule) but more importantly, **it is a necessary tool to allow our Platforms that integrate TalentLayer to claim fee revenues in the form of a desired token on a certain schedule**! In our existing implementation, platforms must claim fee revenues manually, and fee revenues are denominated in whatever token users are transacting with. This means platforms can conceivably have dozens of types of tokens being remitted to them as fees. Lugus will be integrated into TalentLayer’s fees system to create a really nice configurable scheduling and conversion system for marketplaces. The Lugus module can also eventually be used for a referral system (claiming referral rewards) and other applications.

## The Automatic Claim Aggregator & Scheduler

Lugus allows users to automatically claim and convert crypto from yield, escrow, and other types of smart contracts; turning complicated claim management workflows into one-click. 

Go from having claimable tokens across dozens of contracts to receiving scheduled payments in your preferred crypto token; automatically converted and sent to your wallet on a weekly or monthly basis.
